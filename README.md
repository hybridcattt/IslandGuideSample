# IslandGuideSample
Demo app for Collection Views workshop @ [Swift Island 2019](https://swiftisland.nl)

During the workshop will go through refactoring of this app from using
classic UICollectionViewDataSource and UICollectionViewFlowLayout
into using the new diffable data source and compositional layout.

### Part 1: Diffable Data Source

Step 1. Simple data source
Step 2. Creating and updating data in different ways

### Part 2: Compositional layout

Step 3. Basic concepts of compositional layout
Step 4. Trying out nested groups and using estimated height

### Optional excercises 

- Different layout for different size classes
- Section inset based on system layout margins
- Supplementary views, headers


## After the workshop

WWDC 2019 has two great sessions that go in depth into the new compositional layout and diffable data source.
